# About model.py
----------------

This Python script, `model.py`, is part of a color detection project and serves as the core component responsible for color analysis and detection within images or video streams. It leverages popular libraries such as NumPy, OpenCV (cv2), Pandas, and argparse to provide versatile and accurate color detection capabilities.

# Features:
- Color detection: Identifies and distinguishes colors within images or video frames.
- Color analysis: Quantifies the presence and distribution of specific colors.
- Command-line interface: Utilizes argparse for user-friendly command-line argument handling, allowing users to specify input images or videos easily.

# Libraries Used:
- NumPy: Efficiently handles and manipulates multidimensional arrays for color data.
- OpenCV (cv2): Provides powerful computer vision functions for image and video processing.
- Pandas: Facilitates data manipulation and analysis, including color data storage and reporting.
- argparse: Enables command-line interface functionality, making it straightforward to interact with the script.

# Usage:
To perform color detection on an image: python model.py -i path/to/your/image.jpg (open cmd or any IDE)
