# Color-Detection
Color detection is a computer vision and image processing technique that involves identifying and distinguishing colors within an image. It enables computers to recognize and quantify specific colors present in visual data.

## Project

Welcome to our Color Detection project! This project aims to detect and identify colors within images using computer vision techniques. Our system is built using Python and leverages the power of OpenCV (`cv2`), NumPy, pandas, and argparse for efficient color detection.

### Features

- **Color Detection**: The system can accurately identify and distinguish colors within images, making it versatile for various applications.
- **Dataset**: I have included the `colors.csv` dataset, which contains comprehensive color information that the system uses for color recognition.
- **Sample Images**: For your convenience, I provide a set of sample images to test and showcase the capabilities of the color detection algorithm.

### Technologies and Libraries

The project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

- **OpenCV (`cv2`)**: I leverage OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library, to process images, perform color recognition, and handle various image operations.
- **NumPy**: NumPy is used for efficient array manipulation and mathematical operations, which are essential for image processing.
- **Pandas**: I used Pandas to handle and manipulate the color data from the `colors.csv` dataset, making it easy to match detected colors with their names.
- **Argparse**: I employ the argparse library to parse command-line arguments, allowing users to specify the image they want to analyze.

### `colors.csv` Dataset

I include the `colors.csv` dataset in this project, which contains a comprehensive list of colors along with their respective names and RGB values. This dataset serves as a reference for color recognition during the image analysis process.

### Sample Images

To demonstrate the functionality of the color detection system, I have provided a set of sample images. These images cover various scenarios and challenges in color detection, allowing you to test and benchmark the performance of the algorithm.

Please feel free to explore the project, use the provided sample images, and experiment with color detection using the `colors.csv` dataset.
