## Sample Images

In this color detection project, I have included a set of sample images to demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm. These sample images have been carefully selected to showcase various scenarios and challenges in color detection. You can use these images to test the accuracy and performance of the color detection system.

### Image 1: "Houses.jpg"

![Houses.jpg](Images/Houses.jpg)

Description: This image contains a variety of colorful houses in a well-lit environment. It is ideal for testing the basic color detection functionality.

### Image 2: "Colorful.jpg"

![Colorful.jpg](Images/Colorful.jpg)

Description: Sample2.jpg is a high-resolution image with subtle color variations. It is designed to test the algorithm's ability to detect colors accurately, even in complex scenes.

Please feel free to use these sample images for testing and experimentation with the color detection project. If you have your own images or datasets to test, you can easily integrate them with the system by following the provided instructions in the project documentation.
