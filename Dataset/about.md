#Dataset
#Overview
The dataset used for this color detection project consists of a comprehensive collection of color samples representing a wide range of colors commonly found in the real world. These colors were carefully selected to train and test the color detection model. Each color sample is represented by its corresponding RGB values.

#Contents
The dataset includes the following key components:

Color Labels: A file that provides the names or identifiers for each color sample. This file associates each color with its RGB values.

Color Distribution: A summary of the distribution of colors within the dataset, highlighting the number of samples for each color category.

#Data Sources
The color dataset was curated from various sources, including publicly available color databases, open-access image repositories, and custom data collection efforts. Attribution and sources for specific color samples are included in the dataset where applicable.

#Data Preprocessing
Prior to training the color detection model, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to ensure compatibility with the chosen machine learning framework.

#Dataset Size
The dataset comprises a total of [865] unique color samples, providing a diverse and representative set of colors for accurate color detection.
